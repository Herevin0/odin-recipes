# odin-recipes
<p>Hello, my name is Herevin and this is my Odin Recipes project, using only HTML. The main idea is to teach people how to cook eggs, specially if you are a lonely universitarian, a depressive young adult or just a mid-age adult who lives alone. </p>
<p>It will consist in three marvelous simplistic and not-so-tasteful recipes: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Boiled amazing eggs nham nham </li> 
    <li> Fried and maybe burned eggs :D </li>
    <li> Versatile omelet/scramble eggs </li>
</ul>
<p> I hope you enjoy it and learn how to cook your next lunch without having to order pizZa. </p>
<p> xoxo Herevin ãƒ„ </p>
